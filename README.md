# Streamlit-Resume
This is my first work using Streamlit where I created my first web resume.

STEP 01: Create a conda environment after creating the repository
```bash
conda create -n streamlit python=3.7 -y
```
Step 02: Activate the conda environment
```bash
conda activate streamlit
```

Step 03:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Important Note: Install all the packages together

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
